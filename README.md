# (Unofficial) Sentry Theme

So in case you don't know, the artists and designers over at [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io) are excellent at their jobs, pumping out some sweet art and colour palettes. Those colours pop, so I figured, since it's all open-source, why not steal the colour palette to make a nice VS Code theme? Really this is just an excuse for me to have matching colours where ever I can, but if you'd like, you can check it out to! üëç

Take a look at some screenshots:
